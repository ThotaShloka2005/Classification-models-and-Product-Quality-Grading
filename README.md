Overview
This project implements advanced classification models to predict the quality grade of paper based on various physical and chemical properties. It demonstrates multi-class classification using ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy and provides insights into key features influencing the classification.

Features
Multi-class classification of paper quality grades (e.g., Grade A, B, C)

Uses ensemble voting classifier combining Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models

Feature scaling and label encoding for robust model training

Performance evaluation with accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

Feature importance analysis using Random Forest

Real-time prediction function prototype for new paper samples

Dataset
Synthetic dataset created for demonstration containing features:

Thickness

Brightness

Smoothness

Opacity

Tensile Strength

Target variable: grade (paper quality grade)

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

Install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to:

Load and prepare the dataset

Train multiple classification models

Evaluate and compare model performance

Generate feature importance plots

Use the real-time prediction function for new inputs

To classify a new sample, call the classify_paper() function with a dictionary of feature values, e.g.:

python
Copy
Edit
sample = {
    'thickness': 0.68,
    'brightness': 64,
    'smoothness': 0.44,
    'opacity': 84,
    'tensile_strength': 21
}

predicted_grade, probabilities = classify_paper(sample)
print(f"Predicted Grade: {predicted_grade}")
print("Class Probabilities:", probabilities)
Project Structure
classification_model.py - Main script or notebook with model training and evaluation

synthetic_paper_quality.csv - Synthetic dataset CSV (if saved separately)

Future Work
Integrate hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy

Extend dataset with real-world samples for better generalization

Develop a GUI or web app for interactive real-time classification

Implement boundary visualization to better understand grade separations
